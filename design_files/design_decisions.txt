Assumptions:
* A book cannot be borrowed multiple times
* A genre is an Enum
* Deleting an author deletes their associated books

Architecture decisions:
Data Access:
------------
* I decided to implement the generic repository and unit of work patterns alongside
the service layer, ultimately it didn't seem to be particularly beneficial (at least at this scale) and I ended up mostly writing a thin wrapper over DbContext that ultimately propagates to the service layer, this gave me time to study opinions regarding DbContext already implementing these patterns for us and this being a needless abstraction. Regardless, I am sure their are arguments to be made for both sides and hope to learn more in the future

Frontend:
---------
* I experimented a bit with vanilla JavaScript in razor pages to see how it works and I would say there isn't a big difference from just using JQuery
